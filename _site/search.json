Can have about 5 to 6 explanatory variables\n- To derive the geolocations that are essential for our project, we would need to combine both the block numbers and street names to get the location (coordinates)\n\nWe can use Megan’s as a reference on how we could do it (geocoding)\n\nRegarding additional explanatory fields we can use for rental\n- Floor area is very closely related to rental price\n- Age of building, high floor, low floor\nWhat to focus on?\n- How to build the application and expose the functions to the users so that they can configure and get the results/visualisations they need according to the parameters they want to set\n- For eg, allow the user to select a specific housing type\n- It is not necessary to go for too many models, the emphasis should be on understanding the model and being aware of the options you have to customise/configure it\nDistributing of work\n- Data exploration, GWR, Predictive\nShould we do the analysis for both hdb and private estates?\n- Do either but not both\n- If we are looking to do private housing, we can go to URA for the rental database and access through SMU library’s platform which has a more extensive dataset\n- A challenge is that the dataset cannot be downloaded all at once and we can only download part of it at a time"

    "text": "In this R Shiny application, we analyze the rental prices of flats in Singapore using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). This analysis aims to predict and examine the spatial dynamics of rental prices, primarily focusing on the influence of factors such as proximity to transportation hubs. By examining how predictors like access to public transportation and neighborhood characteristics affect rental prices across various towns, we hope to facilitate more informed decision-making in the context of Singapore’s unique urban landscape. This application will provide a visual representation of rental price dynamics and serve as a valuable tool for individuals considering where to rent a flat."

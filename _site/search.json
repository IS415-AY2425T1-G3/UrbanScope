    "text": "In this R Shiny application, we analyze the rental prices of flats in Singapore using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). This analysis aims to predict and examine the spatial dynamics of rental prices, primarily focusing on the influence of factors such as proximity to transportation hubs. By examining how predictors like access to public transportation and neighborhood characteristics affect rental prices across various towns, we hope to facilitate more informed decision-making in the context of Singaporeâ€™s unique urban landscape. This application will provide a visual representation of rental price dynamics and serve as a valuable tool for individuals considering where to rent a flat."

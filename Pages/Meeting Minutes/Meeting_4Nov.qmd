# Discussion Points

**Areas of Improvement**

-   Locations of Interest - Ensure feedback is provided to users when the map does not render due to invalid or missing data for the selected parameter set

-   Might have to add additional stuff for regression in accordance to what the prof taught in class

**Concerns Brought Up**

-   Predictive model is taking an unreasonable time to process and compute

**Possible Solutions**

-   Might need to further scope down to reduce dataset

-   Maybe split dataset by the flat types and render separately

**Additional Things We Need To Do**

-   Host shiny app

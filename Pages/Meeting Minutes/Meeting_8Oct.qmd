# Discussion Points

**Datasets and Possible Topics**

-   Discussed dengue fever as a potential topic but found the dataset unsuitable for analysis.

-   Identified transactional data for HDB, condo, and landed property transactions (last updated in 2022).

-   Includes coordinate data for spatial analysis.

-   Limitation: Only covers properties that were sold or bought, not all properties.

-   Decided against using the HDB Sales dataset due to its similarity to previous years' projects.

-   Brought up private property as a potential avenue for exploration.

**Final Decision**

-   Chose to focus on rental datasets as the topic.

-   Found housing and its proximity to transport relevant, especially in light of recent news about frequent MRT breakdowns.
